	<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div id="bio">
	<p>
	I am an award-winning writer and editor based in Cincinnati, Ohio with a Bachelor of Arts in English with a dual focus in Rhetoric & Professional Writing and Creative Writing, a certificate in Copyediting & Publishing, and a minor in Environmental Studies at the University of Cincinnati. I will be pursuing a Master of Arts in Professional Writing at the University of Cincinnati from 2024-2026.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a biracial lesbian woman, I am especially interested in serving missions that are engaged with <b>AAPI and queer communities.</b> By producing work that serves my communities, I hope to make the world a <b>more inclusive place</b> for all. I believe that storytelling has the power to challenge stereotypes, amplify underrepresented voices, and foster understanding between diverse groups. Through my work as a writer and editor, I aim to create content that not only resonates with people from marginalized backgrounds but also educates and inspires broader audiences.</p>
