<h1>"The World of Lesbian Magazines: From Vice Versa, The Ladder, and Focus: A Journal for Lesbians to Cincinnati’s Own Dinah"</h1>

<p>This newsletter "Dinah's Revival" was created for a class called Queer in the City about LGBTQ+ history in the United States. As part of the class's final assignment, I created a fictional follow-up issue to a Cincinnati lesbian newsletter that ran from 1974 to 1997 with the permission of the Ohio Lesbian Archives. I researched <i>Dinah</i> extensively, utilizing both the Archives and the University of Cincinnati's own library. Classmates submitted themed articles to me and I revised, designed, and printed everything myself.</p>
<p class="links">I submitted "Dinah's Revival" and its accompanying history essay to the <a href="https://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/history/awards/history-department-award-2022.html"  target="_blank">University of Cincinnati's History Department Awards 2022 Contest</a> and was awarded "Best Essay/Paper of Women's History," a prize I am incredibly honored to have received. I had never written a paper about women's history (much less queer history) nor conducted such thorough, first-hand research on a topic. Having designed, written, and organized others' submissions to the zine myself, I feel that I became a better balanced writer through this experience. Through this project, I had not only learned a hidden facet of queer Cincinnati history, but unearthed it for others to learn about in an interactive, engaging zine and reflective essay.</p>
